### Simplify outfit planning

One of the primary benefits of wardrobe management software is the ability to plan outfits in advance. You can mix and match items in your virtual wardrobe to create outfits, helping you make the most of the clothes you already own and saving time when getting dressed.

Users shall be able to visually assemble outfits using a digital interface. This means you can see how different clothing items and accessories work together without physically trying them on. This is particularly useful when you want to experiment with different combinations and styles. By dragging and dropping pieces onto a digital mannequin or clothing grid, you can create outfits effortlessly.

Outfits can be named and tagged for a particular type of event (casual, professional, etc) and a season (i.e. winter) to ensure that the more relevant outfits and presented first. 

### Reduction of duplicate purchases

Another benefit is to avoid buying duplicate or similar clothing items by providing a digital catalog of your wardrobe. With the software, you can create a comprehensive inventory of your clothing items. This catalog provides a clear and organized view of what you already own. It is also what will be available when currating outfits.

Clothing items should be described by the following attributes

- Type: (top, bottom, accessory, etc.)
- Color
- Tags (Optional): "professional" for a suit jacket or "casual" for t-shirt.
- Photo (Optional): to visualize its real-world counterpart

Having a visual record of your clothing allows you to see exactly what you have in your wardrobe. This reduces the likelihood of accidentally purchasing the same item or a similar style that you already own. When you're considering a new clothing purchase, the software enables you to compare it with items in your existing collection. You can check for similarities in color, style, or functionality, ensuring that you're not duplicating something you already have.

Over time, the accumulation of duplicate or unnecessary items can lead to wardrobe clutter. By curbing the purchase of items you already have, you can maintain a more organized and functional wardrobe. Reducing duplicate purchases not only benefits your finances but also contributes to a more sustainable approach to fashion. It lessens the demand for new clothing production and helps minimize the environmental footprint associated with fashion consumption.

### Wear frequency

Tracking wear frequency can benefit both your own fashion statement and help avoid a cyclical statement. By tracking the wear frequency of your clothing, you can make more informed decisions about which items to keep, which to donate, and which to discard. If certain items are rarely worn, it may be a sign that they don't fit well, aren't your style, or aren't in good condition.

Tracking when clothing items were last worn can help identify your favorite clothing pieces and those that get the most wear. This information can guide your future clothing purchases, allowing you to invest in similar styles or colors that you know you'll enjoy wearing. It also helps you declutter your wardrobe by identifying items that no longer serve a purpose. If something hasn't been worn in a long time, you can consider selling, donating, or repurposing it.

A more conscious approach to your wardrobe, guided by wear frequency data, can help you avoid wearing the same clothing items or outfits everytime you do your laundry. For instance, knowing that you wore a red shirt twice last week may encourage you to pick a different color

## Data driven decisions

### Trend analysis

Over time, the software can help you identify which styles and colors you prefer and which pieces you wear most often. This can inform your future shopping choices and help you curate a wardrobe that truly reflects your personal style. As you continually update your digital wardrobe with new purchases and retired items, the software accumulates a history of your clothing choices over time. This enables you to track how your style has evolved and changed, whether it's a shift towards more casual wear or an emerging preference for specific colors or patterns.

By analyzing the data, you can identify recurring themes or patterns in your clothing choices. This might include recognizing that you frequently opt for certain colors, fabrics, or clothing types. This knowledge can guide your future purchases, helping you acquire items that align with your established style preferences. When you're aware of your personal style trends, you can make more deliberate and satisfying clothing purchases. You're less likely to be swayed by fleeting fashion trends that don't align with your tastes, saving you money and reducing the risk of regrettable purchases.

### Budget management

By having a clear overview of your clothing inventory, you can set and manage a clothing budget more effectively. This can help you avoid overspending on unnecessary items and make you reconsider if you *really* need that $300 handbag.
