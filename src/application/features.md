## Clothing item specification

Specifying a clothing item in wardrobe management software involves creating a detailed entry or profile for each piece of clothing in your collection. Here's how you can specify a clothing item:

1. **Item Name**: Start by giving the clothing item a name or description. This should be something that helps you easily identify the piece, such as "Blue Jeans" or "Red Plaid Shirt."
2. **Category**: Categorize the item by its type, such as "Tops," "Bottoms," "Dresses," "Outerwear," "Shoes," or "Accessories." This categorization helps you organize your wardrobe efficiently.
3. **Color**: Specify the color of the clothing item. This information is crucial when you're planning outfits and searching for specific colors in your wardrobe.
4. **Brand**: If applicable, note the brand or designer of the clothing item. This can be helpful when you want to keep track of your favorite brands or plan outfits with specific labels.
5. **Size**: Record the size of the item. This ensures that you can quickly identify pieces that fit you properly when planning outfits.
6. **Fabric**: Note the material or fabric of the clothing item. This is useful for selecting appropriate clothing for different seasons and occasions.
7. **Purchase Date**: Keep a record of when you acquired the item. This information can be useful for tracking the age and wear of your clothing.
8. **Price**: Record the purchase price, which is helpful for budget management and cost analysis over time.
9. **Wear Frequency**: To keep track of how often you wear certain clothing items, you can specify the last time you wore it, which can help with outfit planning and decluttering.
10. **Occasions**: Tag the item with the types of occasions it's suitable for, such as "Casual," "Work," "Formal," or "Party." This aids in outfit planning for various events.
11. **Season**: Specify the season or weather conditions the item is best suited for, such as "Spring," "Summer," "Fall," or "Winter."
12. **Image**: Upload a clear photo of the clothing item. Visual representation makes it easier to recognize items at a glance.
13. **Notes**: Use a notes section to include additional information, such as specific care instructions or any unique details about the item.
14. **Availability Status**: Indicate whether the item is currently in your closet, in storage, or pending alteration or repair or laundry. This helps with seasonal rotation and decluttering.

## Clothing item state

The state of a clothing item depends on its availability and its feasability to be worn currently. Valid states include:

- Ready -> Can be pulled out of wardrobe/closet and worn today
- In storage -> Stashed away (maybe out of season)
- Needs cleaning -> Previously worn and/or soiled. Usually indicates item is in the laundry pile, but could stand in for needed to take it to the dry cleaners or something similar.
- Needs repair -> Item is damaged, but can be repaired.
- To be discarded -> Item is damaged beyond repair or has outlived its usefulness
- To be donated -> Item may have outlived its usefulness, but might still be usable.

## Outfit specification

Specifying an outfit in wardrobe management software involves creating a detailed entry or profile for a combination of clothing items that you plan to wear together. It would consist of the following

1. **Outfit Name**: Provide a name or description for the outfit. Choose something that helps you easily identify the combination, such as "Casual Friday" or "Beach Vacation."
2. **Clothing Items**: List all the individual clothing items that make up the outfit.
3. **Notes**: Use a notes section to include any additional information about the outfit, such as styling tips or any special considerations for wearing the combination.
4. **Image**: Upload a photo or visual representation of the outfit, either by taking a picture of yourself wearing it or by creating a visual collage of the clothing items together.
5. **Date Worn**: Record the last time you wore this outfit. This can be particularly useful for tracking when and how often you wear specific combinations.
6. **Accessibility**: Specify if the outfit is currently in your closet, in storage, or pending alterations or repairs. This helps you manage your outfit options efficiently.
7. **Tags/Keywords**: Add relevant tags or keywords to make it easier to search for and locate the outfit when planning. This could include a season, setting, or occasion
