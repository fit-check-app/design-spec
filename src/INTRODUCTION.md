# Unknown Fitness App

Welcome to the unknown wardrobe app design documentation. This repository houses the design artifacts of an unknown wardrobe app that is being developed by a couple of friends. We have recently completeing our computer science educations and are looking to obtain real-word experience before entering the workforce. We are aiming for simplicity and a focus on content, so we are utilizing [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to manage presentation. 

## About the app

### Features

This app aims to help users track their workouts and see the progress overtime. Some preliminary features include

- Clothing item specification
- Clothing item state
- Outfit specification
- Outfit generation

The finer details of these features have yet to be refined. Any additional features have not yet been discussed

### Application type

We are building a webapp that is capable of being self-hosted. The application will involve a frontend webview and a backend API and database to save application state. For the frontend webiew, we are considering using VueJs. The backend will likely be a Python web service.
